# File Upload Fix Summary

## Problem
File uploads were not working on DigitalOcean App Platform because:
1. The app was using memory storage (correct for ephemeral filesystem)
2. Files were saved to database with placeholder path 'memory-storage'
3. Download function tried to read from filesystem using this placeholder
4. Downloads failed with "File not found"

## Solution
Implemented DigitalOcean Spaces (S3-compatible object storage) integration:

### Files Modified

1. **backend/package.json**
   - Added `@aws-sdk/client-s3` for Spaces integration

2. **backend/src/config/spaces.js** (NEW)
   - Configures S3 client for DigitalOcean Spaces
   - Auto-detects if Spaces is configured via environment variables
   - Falls back gracefully for local development

3. **backend/src/controllers/attachmentController.js**
   - **uploadAttachment**: Now uploads to Spaces when configured
   - **downloadAttachment**: Streams files from Spaces
   - **deleteAttachment**: Removes files from Spaces
   - Falls back to local filesystem for development

4. **digitalocean-app.yaml**
   - Added Spaces environment variables placeholders
   - Includes configuration instructions

5. **Documentation**
   - `SPACES_SETUP.md` - Detailed setup guide
   - `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` - Quick deployment steps
   - `backend/.env.example` - Environment variables reference

## How It Works

### Upload Flow
```
User uploads file
    ↓
Multer receives (memory or disk storage)
    ↓
Check permissions
    ↓
Upload to Spaces (if configured) ← NEW
    ↓
Save metadata to PostgreSQL
    ↓
Return success
```

### Download Flow
```
User requests download
    ↓
Check permissions
    ↓
Check if Spaces is configured ← NEW
    ↓
If YES: Stream from Spaces ← NEW
If NO: Read from local filesystem
    ↓
Send file to user
```

## Configuration Required

Add these environment variables in DigitalOcean App Settings:

```bash
SPACES_ENDPOINT=https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com
SPACES_REGION=nyc3
SPACES_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
SPACES_KEY=your-access-key
SPACES_SECRET=your-secret-key
```

## Local Development

No changes needed! The system automatically:
- Detects local environment
- Uses disk storage instead of Spaces
- Works exactly as before

## Backward Compatibility

- Existing local development environments: ✅ Works (uses disk)
- New production deployments: ✅ Works (uses Spaces)
- Existing files in database: ⚠️ Will show as "not found" (need to re-upload)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Upload file to project
- [ ] Upload file to ticket  
- [ ] Download file from project
- [ ] Download file from ticket
- [ ] Delete file from project
- [ ] Delete file from ticket
- [ ] Verify files appear in Spaces bucket
- [ ] Verify files are in correct folders (projects/, tickets/)

## Cost

DigitalOcean Spaces: **$5/month**
- 250GB storage included
- 1TB bandwidth included
- Additional storage: $0.02/GB/month
- Additional bandwidth: $0.01/GB

## Security

- Files stored with `private` ACL
- Requires authentication to download
- Access keys stored as encrypted secrets
- CORS not enabled (can be added if needed)

## Next Steps

1. Create a DigitalOcean Space
2. Generate API keys
3. Add environment variables to app
4. Redeploy
5. Test uploads/downloads
6. Monitor Space usage
