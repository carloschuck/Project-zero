## 📋 To View Build Logs

1. **Go to:** https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps/7c0342ca-990f-4a09-b599-a3a3b313f465

2. **Click:** "Runtime Logs" or "Deployments" tab

3. **Select:** "frontend" component

4. **Review:** The build error logs to see what's failing

---

## 🔍 Possible Issues

The frontend Dockerfile build is failing. Common causes:
1. Missing dependencies during `npm ci`
2. Vite build errors
3. TypeScript or ESLint errors
4. Missing files (index.html, vite.config.js)

## 🛠️ Alternative Solution

If the Dockerfile approach continues to fail, we can switch to using DigitalOcean's built-in **static site** buildpack, which is simpler and more reliable.

### To Switch to Static Site:

1. **Remove** the Dockerfile approach
2. **Configure** frontend as a "Static Site" in DigitalOcean
3. Use these settings:
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
   - No Dockerfile needed
