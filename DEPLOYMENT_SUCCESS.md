## 📋 Important Next Steps

### 1. Verify Database Migrations ⚠️

The migration job may not have run automatically. To verify, try logging in:

1. Visit your app URL
2. Try logging in with the default credentials above
3. **If login fails**, you need to run migrations manually

**To run migrations manually:**

```bash
cd /Users/carloschuck/Project-zero

# Install doctl if not already installed
brew install doctl

# Authenticate
doctl auth init

# Get database connection info
doctl databases connection get $(doctl databases list --format ID --no-header | head -1)

# Connect and run migrations
export DATABASE_URL="<connection-string-from-above>?sslmode=require"
cd backend
node src/config/init-db.js
```

Or use the DigitalOcean console to run a one-time job.

### 2. Change Default Admin Password 🔒

**CRITICAL SECURITY STEP:**

1. Log in with default credentials
2. Go to your profile/settings
3. Change the password to something strong
4. Consider creating separate admin accounts and disabling the default one

### 3. Configure Email Notifications (Optional) 📧

To enable email notifications for ticket updates:

1. Go to your app settings in DigitalOcean
2. Add these environment variables to the backend:
   - `SMTP_HOST`
   - `SMTP_PORT`
   - `SMTP_USER`
   - `SMTP_PASS`
   - `EMAIL_FROM`
3. Redeploy the app

### 4. Set Up Custom Domain (Optional) 🌐

1. Go to app settings
2. Click "Domains"
3. Add your custom domain
4. Update DNS records as instructed

## 💰 Cost Breakdown

**Monthly Estimated Cost:**

- Frontend (basic-xxs): ~$5/month
- Backend (basic-xxs): ~$5/month
- Database (db-s-dev-database): ~$7/month
- **Total: ~$17/month**

Note: This uses the smallest instance sizes. Scale up as needed.

## 🚀 Continuous Deployment

Your app is configured for automatic deployment:

- ✅ Every push to `main` branch triggers a new deployment
- ✅ GitHub integration is active
- ✅ Build and deploy typically takes 2-5 minutes

**To deploy changes:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin main
```
