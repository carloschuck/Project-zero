# Deployment Checklist - File Upload Fix

## Quick Fix for File Uploads on DigitalOcean

Your uploads are not working because DigitalOcean App Platform has ephemeral storage. Follow these steps to fix it:

## ‚úÖ What's Been Done

1. ‚úÖ Added AWS SDK for DigitalOcean Spaces support
2. ‚úÖ Updated attachment controller to use Spaces
3. ‚úÖ Added fallback to local storage for development
4. ‚úÖ Updated `digitalocean-app.yaml` with Spaces env vars

## üöÄ What You Need to Do

### 1. Install Dependencies (Do this first!)

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

This installs:
- `@aws-sdk/client-s3` - For DigitalOcean Spaces

### 2. Create a DigitalOcean Space

1. Go to: https://cloud.digitalocean.com/spaces
2. Click **Create a Space**
3. Settings:
   - Region: Choose closest to your app (recommend same region as your app)
   - Name: `ticketing-system-uploads` (or your preferred name)
   - File Listing: **Restrict File Listing** (for security)
4. Click **Create Space**

**Cost**: $5/month (includes 250GB storage + 1TB bandwidth)

### 3. Generate API Keys

1. In Spaces page, click **Manage Keys** (top right)
2. Click **Generate New Key**
3. Name: `ticketing-system`
4. **COPY BOTH KEYS NOW** - you can't see the secret again!
   - Access Key: `do00...` 
   - Secret Key: `abc123...`

### 4. Update Your App Environment Variables

#### Via DigitalOcean Console (Easiest):

1. Go to: https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps
2. Click your app ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **backend** component
3. Scroll to **Environment Variables**
4. Add/Update these:

```
SPACES_ENDPOINT = https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com
SPACES_REGION = nyc3
SPACES_BUCKET = ticketing-system-uploads
SPACES_KEY = [Your Access Key] (‚úì Encrypt)
SPACES_SECRET = [Your Secret Key] (‚úì Encrypt)
```

**Important**: 
- Replace `nyc3` with your Space's region
- Replace `ticketing-system-uploads` with your Space name
- Check "Encrypt" for SPACES_KEY and SPACES_SECRET

5. Click **Save** ‚Üí This will trigger a redeploy

### 5. Commit and Push Code Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix file uploads with DigitalOcean Spaces"
git push origin main
```

Your app will automatically redeploy (if auto-deploy is enabled).

### 6. Test the Fix

1. Wait for deployment to complete (~5 minutes)
2. Open your app
3. Go to a Project
4. Click **Files** tab
5. Try uploading a file
6. Try downloading the file
7. Check your Space - you should see the file in `projects/` folder!

## üîç Verification

Check if it's working:

1. **Backend logs should show**:
   ```
   ‚úÖ DigitalOcean Spaces client configured successfully
   üì¶ Bucket: ticketing-system-uploads
   ```

2. **After upload, you should see**:
   ```
   ‚úÖ File uploaded to Spaces: projects/filename-123456789.pdf
   ```

3. **In your Space**, you should see folders:
   ```
   ticketing-system-uploads/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tickets/
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ projects/
   ```

## ‚ùå Troubleshooting

### "Spaces not configured - using local/memory storage"

**Problem**: Environment variables not set correctly

**Fix**: 
- Double-check variable names (no typos!)
- Make sure you saved in the DigitalOcean console
- Redeploy the app

### "Failed to upload file"

**Possible causes**:
1. Wrong bucket name
2. Wrong region
3. Wrong access keys
4. Keys don't have permissions

**Fix**:
- Verify bucket name exactly matches your Space name
- Check region matches (nyc3, sfo3, etc.)
- Try regenerating keys in Spaces ‚Üí Manage Keys

### "File not found in storage" when downloading

**Problem**: File wasn't uploaded to Spaces

**Fix**:
- Check backend logs during upload
- Verify SPACES_BUCKET is correct
- Make sure access keys have write permissions

### npm install fails

**Problem**: Old package-lock.json

**Fix**:
```bash
cd backend
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

## üìä Cost Estimate

**DigitalOcean Spaces**: $5/month
- Includes 250GB storage
- Includes 1TB outbound transfer
- Additional storage: $0.02/GB/month
- Additional bandwidth: $0.01/GB

**Example usage**:
- 1000 files at 5MB each = 5GB storage = $5/month
- 10,000 downloads/month at 5MB = 50GB transfer = included

Very cost-effective for most applications!

## üéØ Expected Results

After completing these steps:

‚úÖ File uploads work in Projects  
‚úÖ File uploads work in Tickets  
‚úÖ File downloads work correctly  
‚úÖ Files persist across deployments  
‚úÖ No more "file not found" errors  

## üìö More Information

See `SPACES_SETUP.md` for detailed information about:
- Security configuration
- CORS setup
- File migration
- Advanced troubleshooting

## Need Help?

Check your app logs:
```bash
# Install doctl if you haven't
brew install doctl  # Mac
# or snap install doctl  # Linux

# Authenticate
doctl auth init

# Get your app ID
doctl apps list

# View logs
doctl apps logs YOUR_APP_ID --type RUN
```

Look for Spaces-related messages at startup and during uploads.
