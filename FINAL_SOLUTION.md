# ðŸš¨ Database Permission Issue - Solutions

## Problem
The `ticketing-db` dev database user doesn't have CREATE TABLE permissions.

## ðŸŽ¯ Solution 1: Upgrade to Production Database (Recommended)

Dev databases have limited permissions. Upgrade to a production database:

1. Go to: https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps/7c0342ca-990f-4a09-b599-a3a3b313f465
2. Click **Settings** â†’ scroll to **ticketing-db**
3. Change from **Development** to **Production**
4. Production databases come with a `doadmin` user that has full permissions

Then run the setup script again.

## ðŸŽ¯ Solution 2: Contact DigitalOcean Support

The dev database might need permissions granted manually:

1. Go to: https://cloud.digitalocean.com/support
2. Create a ticket: "Need CREATE TABLE permissions for App Platform dev database"
3. Provide App ID: `7c0342ca-990f-4a09-b599-a3a3b313f465`

## ðŸŽ¯ Solution 3: Recreate App with Proper Database

Delete and recreate the app with a production database from the start.

## ðŸŽ¯ Solution 4: Manual SQL via Support

Ask DigitalOcean support to run the SQL schema manually with admin privileges.

## âš¡ Quickest Fix

**Upgrade the database to production** - this will give you full admin access and cost only a few dollars more per month (~$15/month instead of ~$7/month).
