Build a full-stack web application that will be deployed on DigitalOcean.  

## Core Requirements
- Web app with a **dashboard** (modern, responsive design with a clean UI, dark mode toggle).  
- **Authentication & role-based access control** for:
  - Admin
  - Regular Users
  - Department Leads
  - Event Coordinators  

## Features
1. **Role-Based Dashboards**
   - Admin: manage all tickets, users, and categories.
   - Department Lead: view tickets relevant to their department, update statuses, assign tickets.
   - Event Coordinator: view event-related requests, track statuses.
   - Regular Users: submit and track their own tickets.

2. **Ticketing System**
   - Ticket submission form with fields: category, subject, description, attachments,   
   - Categories include:
     - Technical Support
     - Web Support
     - Video/Graphics
     - Social Media
     - Other Requests  
   - Tickets should have status states: `Open`, `In Progress`, `Resolved`, `Closed`.

3. **Notifications**
   - Email notifications (on submission, status updates).  
   - In-app notifications for assigned or updated tickets.  

4. **Scalability**
   - Dashboard should include **placeholder tabs** for future functionality (e.g., reports, analytics, user management).  

## Technical Specs
- **Frontend:** React (with Vite or Next.js) + TailwindCSS for modern responsive UI.  
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express) with REST API.  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL.  
- **Authentication:** JWT-based auth with role-based access.  
- **Deployment:** Dockerized app deployed to DigitalOcean as an app platform  

## Additional Notes
- Ensure **modular architecture** for future expansion.
